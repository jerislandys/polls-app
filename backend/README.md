# Polls App

> Polls App with Redux for state management, Reactstrap and react-transition-group.

## Quick Start

Add your MONGO_URI to the default.json file. Make sure you set an env var for that and the jwtSecret on deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 
```

## Deployment

There is a script so that you do not have to compile your React frontend manually, it is done on the server. Simply push to script and it will build and load the frontend index.html page
